Bashscript for handling Docker projects


### imagesorter-v2

Github: [imageSorter](https://github.com/lewenhagen/imageSorter)  
Docker hub: [imagesorter-v2](https://hub.docker.com/r/lewenhagen/imagesorter-v2)

#### How-to

Download the corresponding scriptfile:

* Windows `.cmd` (needs you to grant access to shared folder)
* Unix `.bash`

Run the script and put your photos in the folder "Unsorted". The folder gets created if it does not exist - then quit the program and insert your photos.

Run the script again and select: 1 to start the process. The resulting photos will end up in a created folder named "Result". Your original photos will be intact.
